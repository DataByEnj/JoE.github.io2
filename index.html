											<p>Data Analyst | Excel, SQL, Tableau</p>
										</header>
										<p>Welcome! I’m a data enthusiast driven by curiosity and a passion for uncovering insights through data. My journey began with an interest in cleaning and organizing raw data in Excel, which quickly evolved into turning that data into actionable stories.</p>
										<p>In my experience across the nonprofit and higher education sectors, working in Excel has helped me build a solid foundation and grow in mastering techniques. From data cleaning and organization to leveraging functions, I have developed an understanding of efficiently manipulating and analyzing data in Excel.</p>
										<p>This passion for data transformation led me to explore and deepen my knowledge of SQL and Tableau, focusing on cleaning, managing, and analyzing large datasets. In my professional pursuits, I have developed analytical, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills and consistently use data to help teams report to stakeholders and meet goals. These tools revealed my passion for data management.</p>
										<p>As I continue to grow my Excel, SQL, and Tableau skills, I am committed to using data to make an impact. I’m excited about using my skills to uncover insights that guide decisions and create growth opportunities for organizations.</p>
										<p>Explore my projects in Excel, SQL, and Tableau, which showcase my commitment to using data to create solutions.</p>

											<h3>Academic Performance & Advisor Dashboard (Excel)</h3>
											<p>Project Type: Data Analysis, Dashboard Design</p>
											<p>Tools Used: Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, XLOOKUP, IFERROR, Data Validation, Find & Replace, Data Validation)</p>
											<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
											<p>As a University Coordinator, I developed an Academic Dashboard to improve student advising, reporting, and decision-making. The department previously relied on manual counting and cell coloring within Excel to track student GPAs, enrollment trends, and application data. The process was time-consuming and prone to errors, which made it challenging to generate insights efficiently.</p>
											<p>This project introduced an Excel-based dashboard that automated data tracking, analysis, and reporting. This allowed advisors to quickly identify top-performing and at-risk students, monitor enrollment trends, and streamline advising efforts. The dataset includes raw data to demonstrate the cleaning process before generating insights.</p>
												<p><strong> Key Features</strong></p>
												<p><strong> Student Dashboard</strong></p>
											<ul>
												  <li>Top 5 GPAs and Bottom 10 GPAs for quick identification of high-achieving and at-risk students.</li>
												  <li>Top 5 Colleges Applied To, providing insights into student application trends.</li>
												  <li>Total Students and overall Average GPA to assess academic performance.</li>
												  <li>Highest and Lowest GPA values for performance benchmarks.</li>
												  <li>Application Outcomes: Total number of students applied, enrolled, denied, and admitted.</li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong> Advisor Dashboard</strong></p>
												<ul>
												  <li>Advisor-Specific Student Tracking: Lists students with a GPA between 3.0 and 3.5 for targeted advising.</li>
												  <li>Bottom 20 GPAs with Corresponding Advisors, ensuring advisors can focus on students needing additional support.</li>
												  <li>Average GPA by Academic Plan, allowing leadership to assess program effectiveness.</li>
												  <li>Advisor Lookup: Uses Student ID to retrieve individual student information quickly.</li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong> Impact & Results</strong></p>
												<ul>
												  <li>Improved Reporting Efficiency by 40%: Automated data extraction and visualization processes, reducing manual reporting time and ensuring reports were generated on time.</li>
												  <li>Enhanced Data Accuracy: Eliminated human error associated with manual counting and color-coding, leading to 15% more accurate reports and more reliable insights for decision-making.</li>
												  <li>Streamlined Advisor Insights: Advisors spent 20% less time preparing student reports, allowing them to focus on providing more personalized academic support.</li>
												  <li>Real-time Reporting: Enabled real-time tracking of student progress, academic performance, and enrollment status, reducing the lag between data collection and actionable insights.</li>

											<h3>Exploring Data Science Salaries (SQL)</h3>
											<p>Project Type: Data Analysis, Querying</p>
											<p>Tools/Skills Used: SQL, Aggregations, GROUP BY, Window Functions, Common Table Expressions, Ranking, Cross Joins, and Data Filtering.</p>
											<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
											<p>This project explores salary data in the data science industry, analyzing compensation trends based on experience, role, location, and company size. The goal was to uncover key insights about the data science job market, mainly how salaries are influenced by these variables, which aids in industry career planning.</p>
											<p>It was a hands-on learning experience that deepened my SQL skills and enabled me to analyze compensation patterns and answer critical questions about salary trends, remote work compensation, and geographic differences, providing a comprehensive understanding of industry standards.</p>
													<p><strong> Key Insights & Findings</strong></p>
												<p><strong> Compensation by Experience</strong></p>
												<ul>
												  <li>Analyzed how salaries change across different experience levels, from entry-level to senior roles.</li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong> Remote Work vs. In-Office</strong></p>
												<ul>
												  <li>Explored salary differences between remote and in-office roles, with a deeper analysis to determine if remote positions offer higher compensation.</li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong> Regional Salary Differences</strong></p>
												<ul>
												  <li>Investigated how salaries vary by geographic location, comparing US cities to global regions, and provided a deeper analysis of regional compensation trends.</li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong> Role-based Compensation Insights</strong></p>
												<ul>
												  <li>Compared salaries across various data science roles, including Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineer, to uncover differences in compensation.</li>
												</ul>

											<h3>Exploring Data Science Salaries (Tableau)</h3>
											<p>Project Type: Data Visualization, Dashboard Design, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</p>
											<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
											<p>This project analyzes salary data within the data science industry, exploring factors such as experience level, job role, region, remote work, and company size. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes salary trends, helping myself and users understand how various factors impact compensation.</p>
											<p><strong>Data Visualization Approach</strong></p>
								<p><strong>To present the data, I used Tableau’s visualization tools to create:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Bar Charts to compare salaries across different experience levels, showcasing salary growth over time.</li>
									<li>Geographic Maps to illustrate the average salary distribution by region, making it easier to identify high-paying locations.</li>
									<li>Pie Charts to analyze salary distribution based on company size, location, employment type, and experience level.</li>
									<li>Highlight Tables to display average salaries by job title and experience level for quick comparisons.</li>
									<li>Interactive Filters to enable users to explore salary data dynamically by role, region, experience level, and remote work status.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Key Insights</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Experience Level: Salaries increase significantly with experience, with senior roles earning the highest pay.</li>
									<li>Location Matters: Certain regions offer higher salaries, reflecting demand and cost of living.</li>
									<li>Company Size: Larger companies tend to offer better compensation than smaller firms.</li>
									<li>Remote vs. On-Site: Remote salaries vary, with some companies paying competitively while others offer less.</li>
									<li>Job Titles Impact Pay: Roles like Machine Learning Engineer and AI Specialist earn more than general Data Analysts.</li>
									<li>Industry Growth: Data science remains a high-demand field with strong salary trends.</li>
								</ul>
