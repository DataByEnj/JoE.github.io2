											<p>Data Analyst | Excel, SQL, Tableau</p>
										</header>
										<p>Welcome! I’m a data enthusiast driven by curiosity and a passion for uncovering insights through data. My journey began with an interest in cleaning and organizing raw data in Excel, which quickly evolved into turning that data into actionable stories.</p>
										<p>In my experience across the nonprofit and higher education sectors, working in Excel has helped me build a solid foundation and grow in mastering techniques. From data cleaning and organization to leveraging functions, I have developed an understanding of efficiently manipulating and analyzing data in Excel.</p>
										<p>This passion for data transformation led me to explore and deepen my knowledge of SQL and Tableau, focusing on cleaning, managing, and analyzing large datasets. In my professional pursuits, I have developed analytical, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills and consistently use data to help teams report to stakeholders and meet goals. These tools revealed my passion for data management.</p>
										<p>As I continue to grow my Excel, SQL, and Tableau skills, I am committed to using data to make an impact. I’m excited about using my skills to uncover insights that guide decisions and create growth opportunities for organizations.</p>
										<p>Explore my projects in Excel, SQL, and Tableau, which showcase my commitment to using data to create solutions.</p>
